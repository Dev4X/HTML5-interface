This is a rough proof of concept that shows a few ways that html can be used to interact with apps. There is on app that I have found that has Android Intent Code (Scanner App) in the AndroidManifest.xml as programmed. This is a four line code change that allows the app to launch directly for local apps. It would be nice to find an education app that we could add this too as it looks very simple and easy and would help not only this way of doing things, but launching from inside Android Apps as well. 

The main page has its look, feel and topics from one of Bodo's drawings. It is a picture with hotspots and can be anything we want. HTML allows as many layers of depth as one might want. The Math page has two apps, one that links via the Play Store even if installed. The second app launches the Scanner app and is a very clean way to do things. 

The Music button has a hot spot to open an App via the play store called Animal Piano directly. 

While this concept is really rough and some handling of window size, back button function and, of course, getting that forced move to the play store and some of the app crap that is in these, it has much more capability than might be obvious. That said, I see no reason to spend time glitzing as it shows more than enough function to be useful down the road as is, but I would need some input to understand what would seem to be valuable to others.
