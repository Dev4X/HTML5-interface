This is a rough proof of concept via HTML that shows a few ways that html can be used to interact with apps. 

The somewhat improved version you can download the zip from Github either on your device or another machine. You can then just unzip it so the folder/contents are on your Android tablet or just copy them there from another device where you unzipped. 

To use, just click on the dev4x.html file and open it. Of course, you need the scanner, animal piano and max math apps installed to use those three example links. If connected to the internet, the install option will appear if not already installed. 

I use the HTML Viewer as the app to launch the html file. There is also an app called File Shortcut that allows you to create a desktop icon (via selecting the file, selecting share and then selecting File Shortcut) which helps make the html file scheme work more like an App with an icon on the desktop. 

The Barcode Scanner App by ZXing is one app that I have found that has Android Intent Code (Scanner App) in the AndroidManifest.xml as programmed. It is launched directly even while disconnected from the Internet by clicking on the Math Sub Page (math function symbols - the second graphic). This Intent function is powerful for a local app construct and seems to be a four line or so code change that allows the app to launch directly for many apps. It would be nice to find an education app that we could add this to as it looks very simple and easy and would help not only this way of doing things, but launching from inside Android Apps as well. I will test that more as I find the time and need. 

The main page has its look, feel and topics from one of Bodo's drawings. It is a picture with hotspots and can be most any shape and size desired. HTML allows as many layers of depth of pages as one might want. The Math page has two apps, one that links via the Play Store even if installed. The second app launches the Scanner app and is a very clean way to do things. The Music button has a hot spot to open (if already installed) an App via the play store called Animal Piano directly. 

While this concept is really rough and some handling of window size, back button function and, of course, getting that forced move to the play store and some of the app crap that is in these, it has much more capability than might be obvious. That said, I see no reason to spend time glitzing as it shows more than enough function to be useful down the road as is, but I would need some input to understand what would seem to be valuable to others. 

Open to ideas to improve it. Any questions or thoughts, just let me know,

Jeff
